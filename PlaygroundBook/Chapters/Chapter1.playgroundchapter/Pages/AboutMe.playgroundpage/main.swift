# Nice to meet you
Hello, my name is Albert, and i'm the guy inside the circle up there. I'm 20 years old and live in Brazil (As you sould imagine). I've started programming at 17 and since that i'm learning a lot everyday, it really opened my mind to see that anyone can change someone life, and i hope that I've changed your today.
 
# What do i do?
Currently, i'm a computer science stundent and, at the last 3 months, I've been a Apple Developer Academy student too, wich was my goal since i've joined the college, and it's being amazing, i'm very happy. Programming provided me all this, and I really hope that it can help you to make your dreams real too.

# See ya!
It was a amazing experience, I hope you enjoyned it. Unfortunatly I can't see you at WWDC this year, but maybe in another year. Byee!!
